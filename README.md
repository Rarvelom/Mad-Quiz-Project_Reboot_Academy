# Mad-Quiz-Project_Reboot_Academy
A quiz-style game like Kahoot where the goal is to answer as many questions correctly as possible

**Project Description:**
This project is a Python-based console application that simulates a quiz-style game. Inspired by platforms like Kahoot!, it challenges users to answer as many questions correctly as possible within a limited time, directly from the command line.

**Objectives:**

Develop a terminal-based interactive quiz using Python.

Strengthen Python skills in user input, loops, conditionals, and data structures.

Create an engaging learning tool for practicing general knowledge or specific topics.

Target Audience:
Beginner to intermediate Python learners, or anyone who enjoys quiz games played directly in the terminal.

**Game Features:**

Multiple-choice questions displayed in the console.

Instant feedback after each answer.

Score tracking based on correct responses.

Optional time limit per question (using Pythonâ€™s time module).

Randomized question order for replayability.

**Technical Requirements:**

Python 3.x

Standard Python libraries (random, time, sys, etc.)

Learning Outcomes:

Learn how to manage user interaction in the terminal.

Practice using dictionaries/lists to store questions and answers.

Understand basic game logic and scoring systems.

Gain experience working with console I/O and simple timing mechanics.

**ðŸ”§ Project Setup**

 Initialize Python project folder structure

 Create main Python script (main.py)

 Set up virtual environment (optional)

 Create README file with project description

**ðŸ§  Game Logic Design**

 Define the structure for storing questions and answers (e.g., dictionary or list of dictionaries)

 Plan the game flow (intro, question loop, scoring, final result)

 Decide on scoring rules (e.g., 1 point per correct answer, bonus for speed?)

**ðŸ’¬ User Interaction**

 Display welcome message and instructions in the console

 Prompt user input for each question

 Validate user answers and give feedback

**âŒ› Optional Features**

 Implement a timer for each question using time module

 Randomize question order using random.shuffle()

 Add a score summary at the end of the game

**ðŸ“¦ Content Creation**

 Create a basic question bank (5â€“10 questions minimum)

 Store questions directly in code (initial version)

 Optionally plan for external question loading (e.g., JSON or CSV in future)

**ðŸ§ª Testing**

 Test the game flow with mock data

 Handle invalid inputs gracefully

 Check score tracking accuracy
